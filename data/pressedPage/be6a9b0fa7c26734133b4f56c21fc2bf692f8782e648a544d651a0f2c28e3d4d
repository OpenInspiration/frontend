As the crowd of the Electric Ballroom await her arrival, the usual anticipation is tinged with disbelief: having seen <a href=\"http://www.thepunksinger.com/\" title=\"\">The Punk Singer</a> – the documentary about her in which she talks candidly about her illness – and had our tickets refunded for the Julie Ruin’s cancelled 2014 tour, many of us present tonight thought she wouldn’t come back.</p> <p>This matters because <a href=\"http://www.collapseboard.com/features/interviews/the-original-transcript-of-the-guardian-kathleen-hanna-interview/\" title=\"\">for more than two decades Hanna has been an iconic figure</a>, a loud-and-proud feminist who, with her punk band Bikini Kill and dancier outfit Le Tigre, has melded pop and politics with galvanising deftness. She does it again with the Julie Ruin: stage banter during the hour-long set runs the gamut from Ireland’s marriage referendum to abortion rights, the drought in California and gender essentialism. But whereas in Bikini Kill, Hanna did most of the talking, here she has a sparring partner: Kenny Mellman, previously the latter half of cabaret duo <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki_and_Herb\" title=\"\">Kiki and Herb</a>. Pretending to be chat-show hosts and skitting each other’s stage outfits, Hanna and Mellman make a scintilliating comedy duo themselves, the affection between them palpable.</p> <p>It’s just as well they talk politics between songs, because almost every word Hanna sings is indistinguishable amid the clang and clatter of Mellman’s popcorn keyboards and Kathi Willcox’s space-hopper basslines. The Julie Ruin are a playground translated into sound: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEltsPb8M6Q\" title=\"\">Oh Come On</a> has the angularity of a climbing frame, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjkxuSfUDjI\" title=\"\">South Coast Plaza</a> the spin and swirl of a merry-go-round, and every song makes you want to trampoline. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydo4VS87hBE\" title=\"\">Run Fast</a>, the title track from their 2013 album, is oddly downbeat for an encore but, dealing with the multitude of ways young women are belittled, it argues the need for accessible feminism exquisitely.</p>","linkText":"The Julie Ruin review – Kathleen Hanna fronts a playground translated into

His incendiary, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3XCSlTXFk\">anti-establishment track Great Britain</a> was picked up by Radio 1, causing such a stir when DJ Zane Lowe played it for the first time that he played it again in the same show. The rightwing press were up in arms that the BBC played it at all. A ferocious attack on the state of Britain, the song compared the Queen to Saddam Hussein and accused the state of conspiring to murder Princess Diana. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1458487/BBC-promotes-rapper-who-claims-the-Royal-Family-killed-Diana.html\">The Telegraph</a> labelled it a “diatribe against the British way of life” and declared it “more offensive than God Save the Queen”. In parliament, MPs called for it to be banned. As record labels scrambled to sign Scor-zay-zee, The Streets’ Mike Skinner offered to work with him.</p><p>But for the song’s maker, whose real name is Dean Palinczuk, the brief burst in the limelight presaged a breakdown not a breakthrough. Raised in the tough Nottingham suburb of St Ann’s, Palinczuk is an unassuming, self-effacing character who had spent eight years grafting a reputation for himself in the hip-hop crew Out Da Ville. But after the furore over Great Britain, he withdrew from music and became disillusioned and depressed. The gulf between the critical acclaim he’d received and the reality of his life widened. “Out there, you’re Scor-zay-zee, getting props,” he said at the time. “But the reality is you’re living at home with your mum, broke, angry, signing on, trying to live up to expectations of what a man should be.”</p>","linkText":"Scor-zay-zee: my battle with cannabis, schizophrenia and very cheap trainers","lastModified":1432721946000,"standfirst":"<p>Vilified in the papers and lambasted in Parliament, Scor-zay-zee exploded into the limelight with his shocking debut single in 2004 – then fell into a downward spiral.

underground band’s following has grown in a way they never would have anticipated. This is evident from their triumphant reformation at <a href=\"http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2012/04/the-10-best-moments-from-coachella-2012.html\">Coachella in 2012</a> and traces of their seminal album The Shape Of Punk To Come lurking within much of modern punk music. And let’s not forget their militant <a href=\"http://www.aux.tv/2013/04/qa-refused-on-the-prophecy-of-the-shape-of-punk-to-come/\">stance on veganism</a>, which lives on within the dietary requirements of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/feb/02/beyonce-vegan-food-service-celebrity-trend\">Beyoncé and Lil B</a>. Big fans of the Scandinavian post-hardcore scene, apparently.</p><p>It makes sense, then, to return with a full album. In <a href=\"http://epitaph.com/artists/refused\">Freedom</a>, out on 30 June, the youthful exuberance of “full-on anarchist jargon” is gone, and in its place are songs inspired by time spent “talking about politics, existential issues and what we wanted to present as a band in 2015,” says vocalist Dennis Lyxzén. “We talked about the political situation in Europe, capitalism and how it affects people.”</p>","linkText":"Listen to Refused's new track Françafrique","lastModified":1432630805000,"standfirst":"<p>Premiered ahead of new album Freedom, the Swedish punk band ditch anarchist jargon

Phillips is a bit of an outsider, even a solipsist, who writes, produces and performs all of his songs, tracking each instrument himself on an old reel-to-reel.

(2011)</h2><p><strong>Jonathan Richman – I, Jonathan<br></strong>People pick up on the Ramones and the Jesus and Mary Chain in our sound, but Jonathan Richman is someone else who was playing simple, classic, 50s rock’n’roll in his own way. I wasn’t really a big fan before, but I was told to listen to him by someone who had seen a couple of similarities. It legitimised to me the way I was writing songs: he was relying on three chords and melodies we’ve all heard a million times. Party in the USA sounds like something from the Grease soundtrack, but it’s incredibly pure, naive, direct and fun. Lyrically, too, there’s a no-bullshit thing, but there’s also an escapism in all the references to California. The early demos of our first record sound very similar to his songs, because I wrote them all on an acoustic guitar at the end of my bed – though they obviously didn’t end up sounding that way. We never set out to be the most dangerous or unpredictable band – that’s not who we are – and people might be disappointed when they look for that in us.</p>","linkText":"The Vaccines: the music that

Even though you can’t understand the lyrics in about 25% of it (the nonsensical guy yelling is actually a sample from an obscure 1940s recording of prisoners by folk archivist Alan Lomax), the track’s tropical vibes come courtesy of David Guetta and make it the perfect complement to a day at the beach. While Hey Mama was originally released as part of Guetta’s album Listen in November, it smartly wasn’t given traction as a single until the weather started to heat up. There’s no telling if it’ll have the legs to be considered the song of the summer, but one person who’ll be watching closely is pop songstress Bebe Rexha. While her vocals sound indistinguishable from Minaj’s, Rexha is actually the one belting out the chorus (“Banging the drum like dum-diddy-day, I like the dirty rhythm you play”), but perplexingly went uncredited. Dirty rhythm, indeed! <strong><em>RLD</em></strong></p>","linkText":"Summer jams: Guardian critics pick the songs that will soundtrack your holidays","lastModified":1432318379000,"standfirst":"<p>As the perennial debate begins over which songs will own the summer, our critics chime in with their favourites – and find mobile phones, yoga and polyamorous relationships are the big themes this year</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/494kh","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/nicki-minaj","url":"/music/nicki-minaj","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Nicki Minaj","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/nicki-minaj","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/janelle-monae","url":"/music/janelle-monae","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Janelle Monae","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/janelle-monae","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/david-guetta","url":"/music/david-guetta","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"David Guetta","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/david-guetta","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/features","url":"/tone/features","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/tone/features","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/rob-le-donne","url":"/profile/rob-le-donne","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Rob LeDonne","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/profile/rob-le-donne","twitterHandle":"robledonne","bio":"<p>Rob LeDonne is a freelance journalist and comedy writer.</p>","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/kate-hutchinson","url":"/profile/kate-hutchinson","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Kate Hutchinson","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/profile/kate-hutchinson","twitterHandle":"katehutchinson","bio":"<p>Kate Hutchinson is deputy editor of the Guide.

As well as co-penning the excellent Yo Yo and Little Nikki Says for, well, Little Nikki, she has also worked on songs for Leona Lewis and Bridgit Mendler. Apparently it took a slightly drunken chat with her mum for her to realise that she had her own things to say as an artist, hence debut single My Kinda Swag, premiered here. Having been offered various record deals, she decided she “quite fancied the opportunity to hold up this first piece of pie to the world and say, ‘Look what I made, this is me.’” So what does My Kinda Swag have to say for itself? Well, that title isn’t an indication of what follows. Anyone expecting a Cher Lloyd-style heavy-handed brag-fest is in for a surprise: the theme is “a loving reminder that your worth as a human being is measured by who and what you are”. Built around a simple piano figure, it starts like a delicate torch song, before a metronomic electronic pulse cocoons the first verse tightly. Then the whole thing cracks open with the song’s almighty chorus (and that delicious post-chorus bit where she sings, “I like the kind of people that you roll with” is one of the highlights of 2015 so far).<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>","linkText":"The playlist: pop – Emmi, Little Mix, PYCO and more","lastModified":1432309754000,"standfirst":"<p>A cracking debut from Emmi, a call to arms from PYCO, plus Little Mix explore the breezier side of black magic</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4962p","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/series/the-playlist","url":"/music/series/the-playlist","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The playlist","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/series/the-playlist","description":"Our team of experts curate bespoke playlists for different forms of music from around the world","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/series/listen-up","url":"/music/series/listen-up","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Listen up","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/series/listen-up","description":"Hear album streams, watch videos and discover the best new music\r\n","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/blog","url":"/tone/blog","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/tone/blog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/michaelcragg","url":"/profile/michaelcragg","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Michael Cragg","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/profile/michaelcragg","bio":"<p>Michael Cragg is features editor at <a href=\"http://popjustice.com/\">popjustice.com</a> and writes a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/new-music\">daily New Music blog</a> for The Guardian.

She’s accompanied by the Mutter Virtuosi, made of young musicians granted scholarships by the Anne-Sophie Mutter Foundation. “It is particularly difficult nowadays for highly talented young instrumentalists to receive the necessary support during the crucial early years,” Mutter says. “In addition to the huge sums of money spent on lessons, in many cases financing a suitable string instrument poses great problems as well. Along with high purchase costs, there are the necessary insurance fees. Also expensive are trips to the world’s great artists — contacts that are essential for the development of a young musician. The support of young artists presents a challenge to everyone to whom the future of musical life is as important as it is to me.”<br></p>","linkText":"Watch Anne-Sophie Mutter play extracts from The

Houston-based producer who has one foot firmly in the clattering mania of London grime, has just announced his debut album, which will be released on 30 October via Tri Angle Records. Pandemic is the first taste – one that’s like scotch bonnet mouthwash. A voice remarks in the intro that “there aren’t any people”, and we soon find out why. This is the heart of a battlefield – artillery shells are exchanged in chunky rhythmic bursts as machinery whirrs ominously. It turns out to be just a bit of strafing ahead of the all-out assault during the final minute, as Rabit unloads his entire arsenal on the dancefloor. The result is almost cartoonishly extreme; it’s probably the most violent and overwhelming dance track you’ll hear this year.</p>","linkText":"The playlist – electronic: Rabit, Angel-Ho, Emptyset and

may be more fruitful for the scientifically minded music fan rather than the sentimental. The composer’s latest work, Guud, is a project in which he “deals with scientific and psychological questions”, and is inspired by an obsession with scale, nanotechnology and quantum realm. According to Koosha, the “nano-compositions” he creates are based on “the sonic behaviour of fractal patterns that exist within a stretched or rescaled sound wave but without pitch alteration”.</p><p>Guud is yet another fascinating turn in the musician’s career.

Oramo opted to go back to where Sibelius’s career as an orchestral composer began, pairing En Saga and Kullervo. The two works, completed in 1892 (the former a tone poem and the latter a symphonic suite), were the starting point for what proved to be one of the most remarkable orchestral journeys since Beethoven.</p><p> As Oramo’s urgent performances showed, what is remarkable about both En Saga and Kullervo is that, however much they reveal the 19th-century composers who were Sibelius’s starting point, they also point unambiguously to the future, and to the intensely personal language that he would create for himself within barely a decade. En Saga in particular could not have been written by anyone else. The way in which the tone poem picks up speed as it hurtles inescapably towards its end, looks forward to the way in which the first movement of the Fifth Symphony would transform itself into a scherzo a quarter of a century later. It is a reminder that, musically at least for Sibelius, the line between tone poem and symphony was always a narrow one.</p>","linkText":"BBC SO/Oramo/Torikka/Rusanen-Kartano review – urgent performances","lastModified":1440975627000,"standfirst":"<p><strong>Royal Albert Hall, London</strong><br>Conductor Sakari Oramo shows Sibelius’s narrow distinction between tone poem and symphony;

O’Regan’s opera reflects a divine conflict as sung by Hai-Ting Chinn, who is unfortunately drowned out by the fine Orpheus Sinfonia in the small setting","body":"<p>Given its European premiere at this year’s <a href=\"https://www.arcolatheatre.com/whats-on/grimeborn\">Grimeborn festival</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/31/heart-of-darkness-opera-oregan\">Tarik O’Regan</a>’s monodrama The Wanton Sublime is essentially a religious work, albeit an unconventional one, that meditates on the annunciation and the psychology of revelation. Using a text by American poet <a href=\"http://www.annarabinowitz.com/\">Anna Rabinowitz</a>, it reimagines the Virgin Mary as engaged in an angry confrontation with the God who has chosen her to be integral to his purpose. “Why me? Why now?” she asks. “What would you do if I refused?” The underlying point, integral to much mystic literature, is that divine intervention has the bewildering potential to shatter lives and identities.</p><p> Written for the American mezzo-soprano <a href=\"http://www.hai-ting.com/\">Hai-Ting Chinn</a>, O’Regan’s score brings bluesy rebelliousness and <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Claudio-Monteverdi\">Monteverdian</a> lyricism into close proximity. Mary’s arguments are with herself as well as with God, and Chinn sings against a playback of her own voice singing sacred texts, as Robert Shaw’s understated production charts her transformation from streetwise elegance to a more pliant, albeit resentful figure in <a href=\"http://www.gemselect.com/gem-info/lapis-lazuli/lapis-lazuli-info.php\">lapis lazuli</a> blue. There’s fine playing from the <a href=\"http://www.orpheusfoundation.com/\">Orpheus Sinfonia</a> under <a href=\"http://www.andrewgriffiths.info/\">Andrew Griffiths</a>. But it was a major mistake to perform the work in the Arcola’s cramped Studio 2, where the ensemble frequently obliterates Chinn’s voice, and with it the all-important text.</p>","linkText":"The Wanton Sublime/The Medium review – rebelliousness and lyricism","lastModified":1440716461000,"standfirst":"<p><strong>Arcola theatre, London</strong><br>Tarik O’Regan’s opera reflects a divine conflict as sung by Hai-Ting Chinn, who is unfortunately drowned out by the fine Orpheus Sinfonia in the small setting</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4bpyf","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/opera","url":"/music/opera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Opera","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/opera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/livereview","url":"/tone/livereview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Live music reviews","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/tone/livereview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/timashley","url":"/profile/timashley","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Tim Ashley","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/profile/timashley","bio":"<p>Tim Ashley is a Guardian classical and opera critic, though he's also keen on literature and philosophy so you might sometimes find him cross-referencing all three.

After six years, the band’s own sheer energy blew them apart, setting off&nbsp;further commotions all over the place. Now they have reassembled, not – to quote leading spirit Django Bates – “to be our own&nbsp;tribute band”, but to be as unpredictable as ever. Half this album comes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU55q7sZcP4\" title=\"\">live from their 1990 heyday</a>, while&nbsp;the other half is brand new.

At first, newcomers to Yo La Tengo’s work might find the results irredeemably – even unconscionably – pleasant. Yet over this album’s full running time, there is something magnetically insidious about the way James McNew’s standup bass and Georgia Hubley’s percussion knit together material from sources as diverse as George Clinton and Hank Williams. Does a world that also contains Isis and Donald Trump really need a nuanced folk-rock cover of the Cure’s Friday I’m In Love?

The droney, rambling buds of her 2009 EP <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7WdJjSyJns\" title=\"Mind Raft audio\">Mind Raft</a> blossom here into tauter grooves, drawing on Indian and Middle Eastern sounds, her Armenian heritage, the minimalism of Terry Riley and psychedelic pop. A Beautiful Woman grooves with compulsive tension, Your Creator is both a very strange kids’ TV show theme and the hymn of a new religion, while Komodo shifts between sea-shimmer delicacy and dragon-stomping intent. Deradoorian’s world is as dreamy, hippyish and hipster as her album title suggests and it’s deliciously easy to get lost in it with her.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\"

Imagine Jonathan Richman’s even nerdier younger brother, from Chicago rather than Boston, and you’re partway there.</p><p>But it’s indisputable that he’s having what one might call a moment – a couple of low-key British gigs this week sold out in hours, and those who know him think he’s one of the most compelling artists working at the moment. Thursday night’s show at the Lexington in London was rapturous, and Simon Raymonde of Bella Union was so entranced by his label’s new signing that he went slightly berserk on Instagram on his way home

mechanic’s shop in Kingston, Jamaica. The car park is full of people. Speaker stacks tower in each corner and dancehall fills the air. Suddenly, the sound system cuts and the selector announces that he is going to play a song – one of his favourites. After a blast of ray gun and air horn sound effects, the soft piano opening of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNZH-emehxA\">Shania Twain’s You’re Still the One</a> starts up. When it gets to the chorus, the tune gets a rewind, a common response to a crowd-pleaser, even if it is a pop-country ballad from 1998.</p><p>Last year, posters on the streets of Brooklyn, New York, announced the lineup for the Groovin’ in the Park reggae festival. It included classic reggae favourites such as Marcia Griffiths, Judy Mowatt and Bob Andy alongside new-generation roots singer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/chronixx-roots-reggae\">Chronixx</a> and lovers rock star Beres Hammond. But the headline act was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWdZEumNRmI\">Aussie soft-rockers Air Supply</a>. On Gawker’s Concourse blog, music critic Andy Beta pondered “<a href=\"http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/big-in-jamaica-why-reggae-fans-inexplicably-love-air-s-1625154716\">why reggae fans mysteriously love Air Supply</a>”. This year, Michael Bolton will top the bill at the Groovin’ in the Park. It shouldn’t come as a surprise – Jamaica has a long and loving relationship with the kind of music that the rest of the world often thinks of as shlocky. In the past few years, Michael Bolton, Air Supply and Celine Dion have all performed on the island.</p>","linkText":"Nice'n'easy listening: why Jamaica loves Celine Dion and Air

Along with high purchase costs, there are the necessary insurance fees. Also expensive are trips to the world’s great artists — contacts that are essential for the development of a young musician.

He decides to do a spontaneous gig, as I’ve seen him do a couple of times, and, no matter how what the subject matter or how upbeat the style, he dryly remarks, with a twinkle in the eye, and that gravelly voice - ‘Here’s another sad song for ya!”</p><p>For what is melancholy? It is more than sadness. It is a nuanced mix of emotions that seems steeped in articulacy. It implies there’s something to say about a state of mind and the state of the world. Arguably melancholy is as much a driving force to songwriting as any idea or emotion. Is it a functional form of depression? Perhaps. If so, it certainly served to be so for the likes of Nick Drake, or Joni Mitchell, who later admitted to suffering from such a state throughout the writing of several of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/26/joni-mitchell-blue-hissing-summer-lawns-court-spark-hejira-dylan\">her most acclaimed albums</a>.<br></p>","linkText":"Readers recommend: melancholy songs | Peter Kimpton","lastModified":1440757273000,"standfirst":"<p>Bittersweet, articulate, beautiful or bold?

certainly not an advocate of homophobia or violence.<br></p>","linkText":"Once you start banning rappers like Tyler, the Creator, where do you stop?","lastModified":1440686004000,"standfirst":"<p>If

Ill health meant that Boulez himself wasn’t in attendance. Thanks to the perfectly poised yet dazzlingly passionate performances of some of his largest-scale masterpieces by the <a href=\"http://www.ensembleinter.com/en/\">Ensemble intercontemporain</a> and the Festival Academy Orchestra – the lamenting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k7EXNZqIUg\">Rituel in Memoriam Bruno Maderna</a>, the resonant glitter of <a

It’s not just the Man missing out on a fat Christmas bonus – the salaries of everyone from the junior staff at the band’s record label, Sony, to the lighting riggers on their tour could evaporate.

href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmcxvfVHkfs\">Don’t Tell Yourself It’s OK</a></h2><p>How did the Lemonheads get themselves so thoroughly written out of pop history? Sure, Evan Dando proved himself to be a drug-addled jerk of the first rank, but he’s not alone in that; yes, their career tailed off, like so many other bands. But that can’t be enough to explain why the Lemonheads are barely even a footnote these days, when in the early 1990s, they seemed like the group who could credibly bridge the gap between grunge and pop (“bubblegrunge” was one wag’s description of their style). Maybe it’s because Dando was a) seemingly independently wealthy, b) extremely good looking, and c) apparently not very interested in seeming tortured. Unfortunately, the Lemonheads’ peak coincided with seeming tortured being the principal qualifying factor for alt-rock success, whereas Dando was more interested in the sun, with a sound that joined the dots between Gram Parsons, Belinda Carlisle and Kiss. But that peak was several years in coming: the Lemonheads had formed in 1986, and their debut album, 1987’s Hate Your Friends, was a brittle, sometimes awkward punk-rock record whose main purpose was to remind you how good Hüsker Dü were – there were pointless punked-up covers (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6_FZB3BR6A\">Amazing Grace</a>) and unconvincing hardcore exercises (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0RhJ9FWOA0\">Rat Velvet</a>). But amid the dross were moments where the Lemonheads showed there was something that might lift them beyond the indie ghetto. Chief among those was Dando’s ballad Don’t Tell Yourself. Though it had to be given a plodding drum pattern and fuzzed guitars to fit on the record, this song was obviously the work of someone who had the ability to move beyond the graffiti-covered toilet-circuit dressing room of the album’s back cover. Dando’s gift for the kind of melody that combines euphoria and melancholy was present and correct, with chord changes that are just unexpected enough to raise a smile rather than cause a start. But what would come next?</p>","linkText":"The Lemonheads: 10 of the best","lastModified":1440586937000,"standfirst":"<p>From an unpromising start trying to play hardcore, the Lemonheads developed

In the past decade the black population of Teaneck has escalated as blacks, like their white predecessors, have sought to escape the urban sprawl and tensions of Queens and Manhattan. The city is also home to a number of black entertainers, but by far the most prominent citizens are the Isley Brothers, who honoured the town by using its name for their record company logo.<br></p><p>Ernie Isley lives with his mother in a sleepy ranch house, tucked off a winding Teaneck back road. The white clapboard structure is also home to brother-in-law Chris Jasper and the youngest Isley, Marvin. The three, none of whom is over 24, make up the younger half of the Isley group. The trio joined their celebrated older brothers, Ronald, Rudolph and Kelly in 1969 and it’s not a coincidence that the transfusion of fresh, young talent paralleled the emergence of the Isley Brothers as a vital force in black music.</p>","linkText":"The Isley Brothers: 'Our music is so much more than Shout' – a classic interview from the vaults","lastModified":1438792124000,"standfirst":"<p>As they prepare to release a 23-disc box set this month, we dust off a 1976 Phonograph Record interview with one of the 70s soul circuit’s wildest acts - courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.rocksbackpages.com/\">Rock’s Backpages </a></p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4b9ec","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/series/from-rock-s-backpages","url":"/music/series/from-rock-s-backpages","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"From Rock's Backpages","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/series/from-rock-s-backpages","description":"<a href=\"http://www.rocksbackpages.com/\">Rock's Backpages</a> is the world's leading collection of vintage music journalism.

Why have I missed out on hearing this?

Alongside Harry Dean Stanton and Sam Kinison, they were to be guests on Saturday Night Live, the comedy institution that was must-see TV in US households. They were allowed two songs – their single <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6yi30_what-a-mess_music#from=embediframe\">Bastards of Young</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6yi55_that-s-where-we-re-riding_music#from=embediframe\">Kiss Me on the Bus</a> – both from Tim, their first album since signing to the Warner Brothers imprint, Sire.</p><p>Maybe the band had noted that SNL was having the most disastrous season in its history, and figured their behaviour wouldn’t matter. More likely, they just did what they were wont to do when presented with a golden opportunity: throw it down the toilet, then take a crap on it. The Replacements’ two songs passed in a blur of missed cues, bum notes, stumbling stage moves, appalling clothes, barely off-mic obscenities, and visible and audible drunkenness. They were immediately banned from SNL, and there went another opportunity for the great underachievers of American rock to live up to their talent.</p>","linkText":"The Replacements: ‘God almighty, what were we trying to prove?’","lastModified":1432301240000,"standfirst":"They wound up audiences, were often too drunk to play and got banned from late-night TV.

He grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, and moved to Vancouver after high school to start a music career, initially calling himself Makeout Videotape. After a few years working odd jobs, he recorded his breakthrough album, 2. The 2014 follow-up, Salad Days, brought him wider recognition and his latest album, Another One, was released last month.

But which two acts were they?</p>\n <p>Meat Loaf and Bonnie Tyler</p>\n <p>Fields of the Nephilim and Gene Loves Jezebel</p>\n <p>Starship and Uriah Heap</p>\n <p>The Wonderstuff and the Lucy Show</p>\n <p>2 In 1983, one rock act took to the stage with a model of Stonehenge. Unfortunately, while the band had requested a size in feet, the model was made in metres, meaning they were dwarfed by stone slabs three times taller than expected. Which band was it?</p>\n <p>Spïnal Tap</p>\n <p>Black Sabbath</p>\n <p>Marillion</p>\n <p>Magnum</p>\n <p>3 Which headliner had their sets at Reading and Leeds in 2010 cut short when promoters pulled the plug?</p>\n <p>Arcade Fire</p>\n <p>Blink-182</p>\n <p>The Libertines</p>\n <p>Guns N’ Roses</p>\n <p>4 The festival – originally the National Jazz Festival – ran at several locations before settling in Reading in 1971. Which of the following racecourses has never hosted it?</p>\n <p>Windsor</p>\n <p>Epsom</p>\n <p>Plumpton</p>\n <p>Kempton Park</p>\n <p>5 Among the acts appearing at the 1972 festival were Genesis. But how much were they paid?</p>\n <p>£30</p>\n <p>£175</p>\n <p>£1,500</p>\n <p>£3,000</p>\n <p>6 What did Donita Sparks of L7 throw at disgruntled audience members in 1992?</p>\n <p>Her bottle of water</p>\n <p>Her guitar</p>\n <p>Her pet labradoodle, Patti</p>\n <p>Her tampon</p>\n <p>7 Kevin Rowland of Dexys Midnight Runners provoked the crowd into their traditional pastime of throwing bottles in 1999. What clothing was he wearing to so anger his audience?</p>\n <p>A T-shirt bearing the legend “Slough. Miles better than Reading.”</p>\n <p>A full-length coat made of wild mink fur</p>\n <p>A white dress, stockings and suspenders</p>\n <p>Nothing, apart from a leather codpiece with a flashing red light on its most protuberant point</p>\n <p>8 Which was the first hip-hop act to appear at Reading, in 1991?</p>\n <p>De La Soul</p>\n <p>Public Enemy</p>\n <p>NWA</p>\n <p>Third Bass</p>\n <p>9 Dave Grohl has played Reading and Leeds approximately 254 times. But which band has he never appeared at the festival as a member of?</p>\n <p>Them Crooked Vultures</p>\n <p>Nirvana</p>\n <p>Queens of the Stone Age</p>\n <p>Foo Fighters</p>\n <p>10 After the Leeds leg of the festival moved from Temple Newsam to Bramham Park, the owner of the Bramham estate said the extra revenue would enable him to undertake renovations and improvements. Which of the following was he able to do?</p>\n <p>Add a white tiger to his private menagerie</p>\n <p>Install a two-thirds size replica of the Trevi fountain</p>\n <p>Fully restore the property’s 16th century watermill, and open it as an agricultural heritage museum</p>\n <p>Replace the urns at the cascade ponds</p> \n</figure>","linkText":"'All right Reading!' – test your knowledge of the

Perhaps the last thing you need when you’ve arrived there, brain fuddled with jetlag, is a conversation with Damon Albarn in full manic flow. One minute he’s talking about refusing to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/06/damon-albarn-roskilde-carried-off-stage-following-five-hour-set-africa-express\">leave the stage after a five-hour gig</a> with Africa Express (“Am I addicted to work? Clearly”), the next he’s revealing his passion for picking wild flowers. Then he starts talking about fairies ...</p><p>“I’ve a house that’s built on a piece of land which was a recognised fairy community,” he says, with a straight face, when we meet backstage at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, where Blur are due to play that night. “We had to get a fairy lawyer in. When people come and stay at my house, they go and give them an offering just to keep them happy because we’ve built on their land.”</p>","linkText":"Blur: 'We used to take it in turns to punch each other'","lastModified":1438297276000,"standfirst":"<p>Back in Hong Kong, where they recorded their album The Magic Whip, Damon, Graham, Alex and Dave talk about falling out and making up, the state of British pop music and why 90s Britpop was a wasted opportunity</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4b5mj","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/blur","url":"/music/blur","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Blur","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/blur","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/features","url":"/tone/features","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/tone/features","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/interview","url":"/tone/interview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Interviews","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/tone/interview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/damon-albarn","url":"/music/damon-albarn","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Damon Albarn","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/damon-albarn","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/alex-james","url":"/culture/alex-james","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Alex James","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/culture/alex-james","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/graham-coxon","url":"/music/graham-coxon","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Graham Coxon","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/graham-coxon","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/britpop","url":"/music/britpop","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Britpop","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/music/britpop","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/timjonze","url":"/profile/timjonze","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Tim Jonze","webUrl":"http://www.code.dev-theguardian.com/profile/timjonze","twitterHandle":"timjonze","bio":"<p>Tim Jonze is the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music\">music editor</a> of guardian.co.uk.

It turns out he’s made a whole load of music, too","body":"<h2><strong>1 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwUXgzjd1x4\">Through the Wire</a></strong></h2> <p>Through the Wire, from West’s 2004 debut album The College Dropout, was arguably the most inspirational breakthrough hip-hop single since the Notorious BIG’s Juicy, released nine years earlier. It was inspired by a near-fatal car collision that required West to undergo reconstructive jaw surgery, which in turn meant he had to literally spit the verses through the wire. Although he had previously contributed guest vocals to Abstract Mindstate and Talib Kweli, Through the Wire was West’s first step on the journey from underground producer to megastar.<br /></p> <h2><strong>2<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g\"> Jesus Walks</a></strong></h2> <p>West was never one to shy away from airing his beliefs, and the subject matter of his third single was incredibly contentious upon its 2004 release. In fact, it’s believed this song’s appearance on an early demo recording scared off some of the major labels who were interested in signing West. However, with the help of three music videos, a chorus hook delivered by the Addicts Rehabilitation Center Choir, not to mention a flawless, cadence-shifting lyrical flow, Jesus Walks has become perhaps the most evocative of any of West’s singles. And, despite alarming those major label executives, it became one of Kanye’s biggest hits.<br /></p> <h2><strong>3 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=455opdQ4so4\">Gold Digger</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s second album, 2005’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/28/popandrock.shopping1\">Late Registration</a>, included West’s first US No 1 single as a lead artist, with Gold Digger eventually going quintuple platinum. He’d already appeared alongside Jamie Foxx on Twista’s US No 1 Slow Jamz. He teamed up with him again here, with Foxx reprising his performance in the film Ray to sing verses from Ray Charles’s I Got a Woman, with reworked lyrics to fit alongside West’s rap in this ingeniously executed track. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vwNcNOTVzY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vwNcNOTVzY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do3iJ6DWvpQ\">4 Diamonds from Sierra Leone (Remix)</a></strong></h2> <p>Built around Shirley Bassey’s Bond theme Diamonds Are Forever, Diamonds from Sierra Leone seemed to encapsulate all the characteristics West had displayed on his rise: a buoyant flow, a provocative lyrical theme, and a judiciously deployed sample. However, the original recording was soon succeeded by an official remix. Not only did the lyrics of this version delve deeper into the trade in illegal African diamonds, it also featured a guest verse from long-term collaborator and label-mate Jay Z. <br /></p> <h2><strong>5 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZwMX6T5Jhk\">Love Lockdown</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s fourth album was released on 2008, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/21/kanye-west-808s-heartbreak\">808s &amp; Heartbreak</a> was a distinct change of pace from what had come before. It was preceded by the single Love Lockdown, which saw West taking inspiration from 80s synthpop, with its minimal production and heavy use of a Roland TR-808 drum machine. The single also featured a departure from the sleekly rapped vocal aesthetic of his earlier work, with his singing doing all of the talking, so to speak. His vocals appeared weak in contrast to his trademark raps, drenched in the Auto-Tuned effect he’d later become synonymous with. On paper, it sounds catastrophic, but the result was both fascinating and groundbreaking.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Kanye\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:7i5asq7DMXK5FUIWglwV6V\" width=\"460\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>6 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm5iA4Zupek\">Runaway</a></strong></h2> <p>In the buildup to 2010’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/19/kanye-west-review\">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a>, West found himself in a peculiar position. He’d become as famous for his statements and actions as for his music, making international headlines in 2009 when he stormed the stage during Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech for the best video award at the Grammys. He had split, publicly and acrimoniously, from his girlfriend Amber Rose in 2010, and he was still grieving for his mother, who had died in November 2007. He faced a choice: watch his public persona spiral into artistic insignificance, or he could strive to reaffirm himself and his career. Against all odds, the latter was achieved with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West’s most captivating album, which expressed a vulnerability rarely seen before. The single Runaway, accompanied by a Moonwalker-inspired promo film, is an epic tale of self-deprecation, love and loss, offering a toast to the “douchebags”, “assholes”, “scumbags” and “jerk-offs” (each used as terms to describe West following the Taylor Swift controversy). </p> <h2><strong>7 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44\">Niggas in Paris</a></strong></h2> <p>Hip-hop and fashion have long gone hand in hand, but few artists have shared West’s passion for the catwalk world. He has released collections for Nike, APC and, most recently, <a href=\"http://www.adidas.com/us/kanye\">Adidas</a>, and he name-drops his favourite designers throughout his verse on this cut from his collaborative album with Jay Z, Watch the Throne. Niggas in Paris saw the two MCs delivering an unfathomable rap masterpiece. It also popularised the term “cray” (a truncation of “crazy”), for better or worse. We’ll let you decide.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gG_dA32oH44?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>8 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOrLNHbEzMg\">Clique</a></strong></h2> <p>Another collaboration with Jay Z, also featuring Big Sean, Clique would’ve settled comfortably alongside the rest of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/02/jay-z-kanye-west-watch-throne\">Watch the Throne</a>, released the previous year. Instead, Clique found itself on West’s label GOOD Music’s compilation album Cruel Summer. Built around an implacable, unrelenting beat from producer Hit-Boy, which takes in eastern melodic themes, Clique builds to West’s contribution after verses from Big Sean and Jay Z, and when West arrives he doesn’t disappoint. He’s been discussing the CIA and luxury cars with George Tenet, the agency’s former director. He’s so newsworthy, he needs a personal news crew, he’s the new Elvis, and most of all: “I been talking to God for so long/That if you look at my life I guess he’s talking back.”<br /></p> <h2><strong>9 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT3swdCJrrg\">New Slaves</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s God complex had reached new heights come 2013 with the release of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/17/kanye-west-yeezus-review\">Yeezus</a>. He discarded the luscious, soulful production of his previous LP release for a harsh soundscape of fierce electro and acid house influences, without tempering the arrogance across the 10 tracks, the most hard-hitting of which was New Slaves, on which he teamed up with Frank Ocean. New Slaves explored historic racism, segregation and classism through a brave, undiluted musical assault. It was another middle finger directed towards just about everybody and everything that had stood against West over the past 35 years.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SoKFycTmVU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-SoKFycTmVU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>10 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WibQR0tQ0P8\">Only One</a></strong></h2> <p>Reverting to the heavy Auto-Tuned vocal style, Only One – West’s collaboration with Paul McCartney – appeared as if from nowhere as a New Year’s Day gift to the internet. This was another stark departure from music that had come immediately before. Gone is the angry, confrontational figure of Yeezus, with this single – an ode to his daughter – displaying West’s sensitive side. Billboard noted that the Auto-Tune tended to be used when West was at his most lyrically naked, and this song saw him addressing the spirit of his late mother, before being guided back to reflecting on the family he has made for himself.</p>","linkText":"Kanye West: 10 of the best","lastModified":1427288580000,"standfirst":"<p>The past week may have left you with the impression that Kanye West is most famous for annoying rock fans.
